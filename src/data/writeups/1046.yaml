  If you see how this server is working, it is giving you some encrypted data in hex and asking you to give some input.
   Now, letâ€™s see the given script. Here we used `CBC encryption` from `AES`. Here, given plain text is admin=no! . You will get a flag if plain text is `admin=yes`.let `auth_cookie` be `ciphertext(ct)` and `auth_message` be `plaintext(pt)`.

  So now you have to give some input that pretends plaintext has `admin=yes`.

  #### CBC mode decryption

  1.Now you have to change last three bits to get the flag.
  2. Use xor operation between nth block of ct,pt and n-1th block of ct. (here change bits of IV to change bits of pt(admin=no!)"
  3.change bits of n-1th block(iv in this challenge) in such a way that would give admin=yes in plaintext(pt).

  Now, try this challenge again. If you didn't get,then look up the script.

  ```python=
  from pwn import *
  host,port = "gc1.eng.run",32041
  io = remote(host,port)
  io.recvline()
  ct = io.recvline()[len("auth_cookie =  "):-1]
  ct = ct.decode()
  ct = bytes.fromhex(ct)
  ct1 = ct[:16]
  ct1 = list(ct1)
  ct1[8] = ct1[8]^ ord('!') ^ ord('s')
  ct1[7] = ct1[7]^ ord('o') ^ ord('e')
  ct1[6] = ct1[6]^ ord('n') ^ ord('y')
  ct1 = bytes(ct1)
  ct = (ct1+ct[16:]).hex()
  io.recvuntil(b"Input authorized information that is required to get the flag: ")
  io.sendline(ct.encode())
  io.recv()
  io.recv()
  ```
