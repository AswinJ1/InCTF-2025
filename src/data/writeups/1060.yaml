  Here we were given with a quadratic equation

  it's a perfect square which states that our roots are *perfect squares*,here  `p^2,q^2` are the roots of the quadratic equation.

  if a,b are roots of an quadratic equation then the quadratic equation will be `x^2-(a+b)*x+a*b=0`.


  **solving for p,q** :
  Note:

  As we have p+q,p-q we can get p,q	
  #### Exploit
  ```python=
  from Crypto.Util.number import *
  from gmpy2 import *
  Sum = iroot(b+(2*n),2)[0]
  Diff = iroot(b-(2*n),2)[0]
  p = (Sum+Diff)//2
  q = Sum-p
  e=65537
  phi=(p-1)*(q-1)
  d= inverse(e,phi)
  flag=long_to_bytes(pow(ct,d,n))
  print(flag)
  ```
