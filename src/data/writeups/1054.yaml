  #### Analysis

  After login in, we can see that its asks for an admin cookie
  if we check we can see a cookie named ``user`` is there with a base64 encoded value

  #### Solution 

  we just have to decode the cookie we can see a JSON string like this

  ``{"username":"username","admin":"False"}
  ``

  we just have to make the admin true like this

  ``{"username":"username","admin":"True"}
  ``
  then base64 encode it and give it as the cookie value
