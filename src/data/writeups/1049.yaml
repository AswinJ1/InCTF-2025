  There are set of strings. In the first for loop ``1`` is replaced with ``0``.

  In the next for loop, output strings after doing above replacement are combined with ``z`` in between them.

  In the final string, ``z`` is replaced with ``a``. This final string is compared with our input hash.

  ``04a5a2af0eb53473a4a2efb3dafa02df`` is the hash we get. Decrypting that in crackstation we get the string ``mockingbird78209``.

  ```python= 
  l=["14","5","2","f1eb53473","4","2efb3d","f","12df"]
  join_char1="z"
  join_char2=""
  s=join_char1.join(l)
  l1=list(s)
  hash_str=[]
  for i in l1:
      if(i=="1"):
          hash_str.append("0")
      elif(i=="z"):
          hash_str.append("a")
      else:
          hash_str.append(i)
  print(join_char2.join(hash_str))
  ```
